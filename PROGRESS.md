- [x] Documentation
  - [x] README.md with quick start
  - [x] SETUP.md with detailed instructions
  - [x] test_setup.sh script
  - [x] PRD.md with full requirements + extensibility architecture
  - [x] CLAUDE.md for AI assistant guidance
  - [x] ADDING_AGENTS.md - comprehensive guide for adding new agents
  - [x] EXTENSIBILITY.md - architecture overview and business value
  - [x] AGENT_CATALOG.md - complete list of all 8 agents with examples

### API Endpoints Working
- `GET /health` - Health check
- `GET /api/v1/workflows` - List workflows
- `POST /api/v1/workflows` - Create workflow
- `GET /api/v1/workflows/{id}` - Get workflow
- `PUT /api/v1/workflows/{id}` - Update workflow
- `DELETE /api/v1/workflows/{id}` - Delete workflow
- `GET /api/v1/connectors` - List connectors
- `GET /api/v1/connectors/{id}/schema` - Get connector schema
- `GET /api/v1/agents/types` - **List agent types (dynamically from registry!)**
- `GET /api/v1/agents/types/{type}/schema` - **Get config schema for agent (NEW!)**
- `POST /api/v1/documents/upload` - Upload document
- `GET /api/v1/documents` - List documents
- `POST /api/v1/executions` - Execute workflow (placeholder)

### Deliverable
âœ… Can start/stop app locally, mock data ready, API docs accessible
