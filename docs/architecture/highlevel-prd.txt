The roadmap is specifically designed to leverage the immediate value of SFDC, Darwinbox, and Outlook integrations early in the lifecycle to secure executive buy-in while systematically addressing the stringent governance and security requirements (CISO mandate) necessary for a high-ACV product sold to the CIO organization.

Super Agent Framework Product Roadmap: MVP to Production
Release 1: Minimum Viable Product (MVP) & Proof of Concept
Goal: Validate the core technical feasibility of agentic reasoning, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and the specific integrations required for the initial high-value use case (e.g., Unified HR/Sales Intelligence). The primary focus is speed, rapid deployment, and proving ROI via automated knowledge retrieval.

Feature Category	MVP Scope and Requirements	Business Rationale	Citations
Agentic Core	Visual Workflow Builder: Low-code interface to create, test, and deploy single-agent workflows.	
Accelerates development time from months to hours. Allows existing technical teams to build agents without specialized MLOps knowledge.   

1
Core RAG Engine	
Basic RAG capability with support for document upload. Initial Connectors: S3, Google Drive, and SharePoint for unstructured data ingestion.   

Builds dynamic AI knowledge base quickly. Ensures responses are grounded in enterprise data (RAG) rather than generic model knowledge.   

2
Pre-Packaged Connectors (PoC)	SFDC, Darwinbox, & Outlook (Read-Only API): Implement basic, standardized API connectors to ingest data (e.g., employee records, contact history, email metadata) into the RAG system for contextual queries.	
Immediately targets cross-functional use cases (HR/Sales/Communication) and demonstrates quick ROI on a small, contained data set.   

3
Deployment	
SaaS and Starter VPC Deployment: Offer a free/low-cost tier for prototyping. Provide initial self-hosted option (via Docker/K8s) for early customers requiring internal VPC isolation.   

Supports organizational experimentation and rapid time-to-market.   

4
LLMOps & Monitoring	
Basic Execution Logs: Track workflow executions and basic API response metrics for debugging and simple performance tracking.   

Provides visibility into agent reliability and early usage patterns.	5

Release 2: Enterprise Core & Governance (General Availability)
Goal: Achieve production readiness for core enterprise systems, implement full-lifecycle LLMOps capabilities, and introduce the foundational governance layer needed to satisfy CIOs/CISOs. This release transitions the product from a tool to an enterprise platform.

Feature Category	Core Release Scope and Requirements	Business Rationale	Citations
Advanced Integration	
Dual-Protocol API Wrapper: Develop a dedicated architectural layer to handle complex systems (e.g., Workday, SAP ERP) that require both modern REST and legacy SOAP protocols for critical functions.   

Unlocks high-value, complex workflows (e.g., automated performance reviews, procurement) that require full transactional integrity across ERPs.   

Cost & Observability	
Full LLMOps Observability Suite: Implement Token-level Tracing and Spend Caps. Implement OpenTelemetry (O11y) Export for integration into existing enterprise monitoring tools (e.g., Datadog).   

Transforms variable AI costs into predictable budget lines, a critical requirement for CIOs. Provides full transparency over model performance and resource consumption.   

Data Security & PII	
Mandatory PII Detection and Masking: Implement PII masking (e.g., names, addresses) on all data ingested into the RAG system and vector store, and on agent outputs.   

Mitigates data breach risk by ensuring that sensitive information is anonymized, even if the knowledge base is compromised.   

Model Lifecycle	
Built-in LLM Evaluations (LLM Evals): Provide frameworks for running offline and live evals to score answer quality and reduce hallucinations before and after deployment. Seamless Fine-Tuning integration.   

Guarantees model accuracy and minimizes model drift in production environments.	
Deployment Sovereignty	
Air-Gapped Deployment Support: Finalize the deployment capability via Helm chart/K8s for fully disconnected/air-gapped environments. Custom SSO Integration (e.g., SAML/LDAP).   

Essential prerequisite for regulated organizations (Finance, Healthcare, Government) for compliance and data sovereignty.   

  
Release 3: Advanced Autonomy & Compliance (Scale & Risk Mitigation)
Goal: Unlock the highest level of autonomous execution, mitigate the most advanced agent-specific security threats (CISO mandate), and achieve formal compliance status to justify the premium, Governance Tier pricing.

Feature Category	Advanced Release Scope and Requirements	Business Rationale	Citations
Super Agent Orchestration	
Rich Multi-Agent Framework: Implement complex orchestration logic for multi-agent conversations and dynamic Task Decomposition.   

Enables the automation of highly complex, non-deterministic business processes that span multiple departments (e.g., cross-departmental procurement).   

Security Governance	
Immutable Audit Logging: Implement non-tamperable, chronological audit logs for every agent decision, tool call, and policy evaluation.   

Provides the verifiable decision lineage required for regulatory compliance and forensic accountability when agents execute high-value transactions.   

Agent Authorization	
Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) / Policy Decision Point (PDP): Implement centralized authorization to mitigate agent-specific threats like Tool Chain Privilege Escalation.   

Prevents agents from bypassing business logic or chaining authorized read actions into unauthorized decisions, securing the environment from advanced threats.   

Compliance & Trust	
Formal Certification & Attestation: Achieve SOC 2 Type II Attestation and pursue ISO 27001 Certification.   

Transforms the framework into a trusted vendor product. Essential for bypassing procurement hurdles and justifying premium pricing (Governance Tier).   

Operational Excellence	
Full Non-Human Identity Management: Implement robust governance over agent credentials (API keys, tokens) to prevent privilege creep and credential exploitation.   

Secures the platform against silent security risks inherent in autonomous systems using high-privilege service accounts.
