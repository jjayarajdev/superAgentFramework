# Dynamic Multi-Agent Orchestration

## Overview

**Dynamic Multi-Agent Orchestration** is a powerful feature that allows SuperAgent to intelligently compose and execute multiple agents on-the-fly, even when no pre-defined workflow exists.

## The Problem It Solves

Traditional workflow systems require users to manually create workflows in advance. But what happens when a user asks:

> "Find all high-value deals in Salesforce and notify the team on Slack"

If no workflow exists for this exact combination, the system would fail. **Dynamic Orchestration solves this**.

## How It Works

### Architecture Flow

```
User Query
    ‚Üì
1. Intent Classification (LLM)
    ‚Üì
2. Workflow Matching (tries to find existing workflow)
    ‚Üì
3. If NO match ‚Üí Dynamic Orchestration
    ‚Üì
4. LLM creates Execution Plan
    ‚Üì
5. Build Ad-hoc Workflow
    ‚Üì
6. Execute via Orchestrator Engine
    ‚Üì
7. Return Results
```

### Key Components

#### 1. Intent Classification

The Supervisor Agent uses GPT-4 to analyze the user's query and determine:

```json
{
  "execution_type": "multi_agent",  // Single agent, workflow, or multi-agent
  "primary_action": "retrieve_data",
  "entities": {
    "deal_filter": "high_value",
    "notification_channel": "#sales"
  },
  "agent_hints": ["sales_intelligence", "slack"],
  "workflow_hints": []
}
```

#### 2. Execution Plan Creation

If no workflow matches, the system asks the LLM to create a detailed execution plan:

```json
{
  "agents": [
    {
      "type": "sales_intelligence",
      "config": {
        "filter": "high_value",
        "sort_by": "amount"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "slack",
      "config": {
        "channel": "#sales",
        "message_format": "summary"
      }
    }
  ],
  "data_flow": "sequential",
  "rationale": "First fetch high-value deals, then notify team with results"
}
```

#### 3. Ad-hoc Workflow Construction

The system dynamically creates a temporary `Workflow` object:

```python
workflow = Workflow(
    id="adhoc_abc123",
    name="Dynamic: Find deals and notify team",
    agents=[
        AgentNode(id="agent_1", type=AgentType.SALES_INTELLIGENCE, ...),
        AgentNode(id="agent_2", type=AgentType.SLACK, ...)
    ],
    edges=[
        WorkflowEdge(source="agent_1", target="agent_2")
    ]
)
```

#### 4. Execution via Orchestrator

The ad-hoc workflow is executed using the same `OrchestrationEngine` that handles pre-defined workflows, ensuring:

- Consistent agent execution
- Proper data passing between agents
- Metrics tracking (tokens, cost, latency)
- Error handling
- Audit logging

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Sales + Notification

**Query**: "Find high-value deals closing this quarter and notify team on Slack"

**Result**:
```
ü§ñ Dynamic Multi-Agent Orchestration

Intent Detected:
‚Ä¢ Type: multi_agent
‚Ä¢ Action: retrieve_and_notify
‚Ä¢ Entities: {"deal_filter": "high_value", "timeframe": "Q4"}
‚Ä¢ Query: "Find high-value deals closing this quarter and notify team"

Execution Plan:
‚Ä¢ Agents: 2
‚Ä¢ Flow: sequential
‚Ä¢ Rationale: First fetch deals, then send Slack notification

Agent Chain:
1. Sales_Intelligence (config: {"filter": "high_value", "quarter": "Q4"})
2. Slack (config: {"channel": "#sales"})

Results:
Found 15 high-value deals worth $2.3M
Notified team on #sales channel

‚úÖ Execution ID: exec_a1b2c3d4
```

### Example 2: HR + Email

**Query**: "Get new hires from Workday and send welcome emails"

**Result**:
- Agent 1: Workday ‚Üí Fetch new hires (last 7 days)
- Agent 2: Email Outreach ‚Üí Send personalized welcome emails

### Example 3: Support Ticket + Jira

**Query**: "Find critical ServiceNow incidents and create Jira tickets"

**Result**:
- Agent 1: ServiceNow ‚Üí Query critical incidents
- Agent 2: Jira ‚Üí Create tickets with incident details

## Technical Implementation

### File: `backend/agents/supervisor_agent.py`

**Key Methods**:

1. **`_orchestrate_agents()`** (line 556)
   - Main entry point for dynamic orchestration
   - Creates execution plan, builds workflow, executes

2. **`_create_execution_plan()`** (line 681)
   - Calls LLM to determine optimal agent order and configuration
   - Returns structured execution plan

3. **`_build_adhoc_workflow()`** (line 752)
   - Constructs temporary Workflow object from plan
   - Maps agent hints to AgentType enums

4. **`_map_agent_type()`** (line 808)
   - Maps string hints to AgentType enum values

### File: `backend/routers/chat.py`

**Response Formatting** (line 209):
- Special handling for `workflow_type: "dynamic_orchestration"`
- Displays execution plan, agent chain, and results

## Advantages

### 1. **Zero Configuration**
Users don't need to pre-create workflows. The system adapts to any valid agent combination.

### 2. **LLM Intelligence**
The system intelligently determines:
- Which agents to use
- In what order
- With what configuration
- How data should flow

### 3. **Consistent Execution**
Uses the same battle-tested orchestrator as pre-defined workflows.

### 4. **Full Audit Trail**
All dynamic executions are logged with:
- Execution ID
- Input/output
- Metrics (tokens, cost, latency)
- Agent-by-agent breakdown

### 5. **Extensibility**
Add new agents ‚Üí They're automatically available for dynamic orchestration.

## Comparison: Pre-defined vs Dynamic

| Feature | Pre-defined Workflow | Dynamic Orchestration |
|---------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Setup Required** | Yes - Manual creation | No - Zero config |
| **Reusability** | High | One-time execution |
| **Customization** | Fixed configuration | Adapts to query |
| **Optimization** | Can be fine-tuned | LLM determines best approach |
| **Audit** | Full history | Full history |
| **Performance** | Faster (no planning) | Slight overhead (LLM planning) |

## Best Practices

### When to Use Dynamic Orchestration

‚úÖ **Good Use Cases**:
- Ad-hoc, one-time queries
- Exploring agent combinations
- Prototyping new workflows
- User doesn't know workflow exists

‚ùå **Avoid For**:
- Frequent, repeated operations
- Performance-critical paths
- Large-scale batch processing

**Recommendation**: If a query is executed frequently, convert it to a pre-defined workflow for better performance.

### Configuration

The system uses these defaults:

```python
SupervisorConfig(
    llm_provider="openai",
    model="gpt-4",
    workflow_matching_threshold=0.7  # 70% similarity to match workflow
)
```

## Monitoring & Debugging

### Logs

Dynamic orchestration produces detailed logs:

```
[INFO] [chat_supervisor] Orchestrating agents dynamically: ['sales_intelligence', 'slack']
[INFO] [chat_supervisor] Execution plan: {"agents": [...], "data_flow": "sequential"}
[INFO] [chat_supervisor] Dynamic orchestration completed: exec_abc123
```

### Execution Tracking

All executions are stored in the `executions` table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM executions
WHERE workflow_id = 'adhoc_multi_agent'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Metrics

Track:
- Total tokens used (LLM planning + agent execution)
- Total cost
- Latency breakdown per agent
- Success/failure rates

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 1 (Current) ‚úÖ
- Sequential agent chaining
- LLM-based planning
- Basic configuration

### Phase 2 (Planned)
- Parallel agent execution
- Conditional branching (if-then-else)
- Loop support (for-each)
- Human-in-the-loop approvals

### Phase 3 (Future)
- Learning from executions
- Automatic workflow suggestion ("Convert to workflow?")
- Performance optimization
- Multi-step reasoning

## API Reference

### Chat Endpoint

**POST** `/api/v1/chat/message`

```json
{
  "message": "Find high-value deals and notify team"
}
```

**Response**:

```json
{
  "response": "ü§ñ Dynamic Multi-Agent Orchestration...",
  "workflow_executed": null,
  "agents_used": ["sales_intelligence", "slack"],
  "execution_id": "exec_abc123",
  "status": "success"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Need at least 2 agents for dynamic orchestration"

**Cause**: LLM identified only 1 agent

**Solution**: Rephrase query to be more explicit about needing multiple agents

### Issue: Dynamic orchestration fails

**Cause**: Agent hint not mapped to AgentType enum

**Solution**: Add mapping in `_map_agent_type()` method

### Issue: Poor execution plan

**Cause**: LLM hallucination or unclear intent

**Solution**:
1. Check LLM prompt in `_create_execution_plan()`
2. Add more context about available agents
3. Improve intent classification

## Security Considerations

1. **Authorization**: Dynamic workflows respect org/team boundaries
2. **Agent Permissions**: Agents still require proper credentials
3. **Audit Logging**: All executions are logged for compliance
4. **Rate Limiting**: LLM calls are rate-limited to prevent abuse

## Conclusion

Dynamic Multi-Agent Orchestration represents a paradigm shift in workflow automation:

**Before**: Users manually create workflows for every scenario
**After**: System intelligently adapts to any valid agent combination

This makes SuperAgent truly intelligent, flexible, and user-friendly! üöÄ
